# CPU Context Switching Simulator

**Operating Systems Project | C++ Backend & Python Visualizer**

---

## Project Overview
This project simulates **CPU context switching** between multiple processes using popular scheduling algorithms:

- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

It provides a **C++ backend** for process simulation and a **Python GUI frontend** for real-time visualization, helping users understand how CPU switches between processes.

---

## Features

- Fetch **system processes** (Windows/Linux) or add **custom processes**
- Supports **dynamic arrival times, burst times, and priority levels**
- Implements **context switch logging** with reasons and timestamps
- Calculates and displays:
  - CPU utilization
  - Average waiting time
  - Average turnaround time
  - Average response time
  - Throughput
- Exports simulation results to **CSV files**:
  - `context_switch_log.csv` → process info
  - `context_switches.csv` → detailed context switch events
- **Python GUI visualizer** for interactive process execution view

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** C++ (process simulation & scheduling)
- **Frontend:** Python (Tkinter, Matplotlib, Pandas)
- **Cross-platform:** Works on **Windows** and **Linux**

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd context-switching-simulator

### 2. Compile & Run C++ Backend
g++ -o scheduler scheduler.cpp
./scheduler


Select input method (system processes or custom processes)

Select scheduling algorithm

Enter time quantum (recommended: 2)

Backend will generate CSV files:

context_switch_log.csv

context_switches.csv

3. Run Python GUI Frontend
python visualizer.py
The GUI reads context_switch_log.csv and context_switches.csv

Visualizes process execution timeline and context switches in Gantt-chart style

Usage Example

Run C++ backend (scheduler.cpp) → simulation completes → CSV files generated.
Run Python frontend (visualizer.py) → interactive process timeline appears.
Observe how processes switch CPU, wait times, and completion times.
